How to run the Graph Visualizer app:

1.  **Save the Code:** Make sure you have saved the Python code for the visualizer (from the code document I provided earlier) into a file named something like `graph_visualizer.py`.
2.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Open a terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows).
3.  **Navigate to Directory:** Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you saved the `graph_visualizer.py` file.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/folder
    ```
4.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python graph_visualizer.py
    ```

**Important:** Remember, this is a GUI application. You need to run this command on a computer with a graphical desktop environment (like standard Windows, macOS, or a Linux desktop). It won't work correctly if run on a server without a display or via a basic SSH connection without X11 forwarding.
